# Apple Watch Icon Exporter

This is a Photoshop script for creating Apple Watch icons from a single large file. It's based on [@sponno](https://github.com/sponno)'s [iPhone-Photoshop-JSX-Icon-Exporter](https://github.com/sponno/iPhone-Photoshop-JSX-Icon-Exporter) project.

## Usage

This script assumes a 1024x1024 source file. Drag the script to the Photoshop icon to run, then select your source file. It creates all files in a subdirectory next to the source file named "generated".

The script generates all the image files [listed in the HIG](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/WatchHumanInterfaceGuidelines/IconandImageSizes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014992-CH16-SW1).
